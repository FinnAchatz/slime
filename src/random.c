/* This is xoshiro128++ 1.0, one of our 32-bit all-purpose, rock-solid
   generators. It has excellent speed, a state size (128 bits) that is
   large enough for mild parallelism, and it passes all tests we are aware
   of.

   For generating just single-precision (i.e., 32-bit) floating-point
   numbers, xoshiro128+ is even faster.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. */
